# Configurable
Configurable example where you can toggle settings of the `GraphView` widget and see the result immediately.
It also contains controls to play with the graph.

This example also demonstrates the usage of force-directed layout implemented on client side. The implementation is compatible with folding and unfolding of nodes modifying edge forces of the affected nodes.

## run
```bash
cargo run --release -p configurable
```
