## üöÄHighlights for v0.27.0

### üÜï New Features

- Hover Interactions: Added from scratch! Graph nodes and edges now support hover effects, enabling more interactive and intuitive graph exploration.
- Custom Styling Hooks: Support for node and edge style hooks, allowing flexible and dynamic visual customization.
- Force-Directed Layout Enhancements:
  - Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm and extra forces for any force-directed graph.
  - Fast-forward feature for animated layouts.
  - Exposed force with an Extras wrapper for advanced usage.

### üñ•Ô∏è  Demo & Usability Improvements

- Event filters, show/hide panels, and enhanced keybindings for better demo interactivity.
- Keybindings overlay replaced with a modern modal window.
- Debug overlay now displays steps count for animated layouts.
- Synchronized sliders and keybindings for a smoother demo experience.

###  üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Robustness

- Fixed 1-frame edge glitch and improved edge overlap handling.
- Fit-to-screen now works for single-node graphs.
- Guards for empty graphs and demo refactoring for robustness.
- Prevented negative tolerance in bezier curves.

üóÉÔ∏è Serialization

- Ensured the graph is fully serde serializable/deserializable.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/blitzar-tech/egui_graphs/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0

## v0.26.0 (09.08.2025)

### Highlights

- Added naive force-directed layout (Fruchterman‚ÄìReingold style) with adjustable simulation parameters.
- Demo now has a Force Directed panel (sliders + info tooltips) for live tuning.
- Refactored layout logic into smaller private helpers and added physics unit tests.
- Added layout state get/set API on `GraphView` for external control/persistence.
- Bumped `egui` to `0.32` (and refreshed related dev dependencies).
- Hardened Linux CI (installs required system libraries).
- README and doctests updated.

### What's Changed

- Force-directed layout + tunable State.
- Demo: force-directed controls + tooltips.
- Layout step refactor (helpers private) + physics tests.
- Added GraphView::get_layout_state / set_layout_state.
- Larger debug overlay text in demo.
- CI: install ALSA & windowing deps on Linux.
- README: concise force-directed section.
- Doctest updated to use g() accessor.
- egui bumped to 0.32.

### MRs

- Renaming and API stabilization by @blitzarx1 in https://github.com/blitzar-tech/egui_graphs/pull/240
- Add Layout and LayoutState to public scope by @blitzarx1 in https://github.com/blitzar-tech/egui_graphs/pull/248
- FDG layout, egui bump by @blitzarx1 in https://github.com/blitzar-tech/egui_graphs/pull/249

### Breaking Changes

- `Graph` no longer exposes its internal graph via a public field (`graph.g`); use accessor methods:
  - Before: `graph.g.node_count()`
  - After: `graph.g().node_count()`
  - For mutation: `graph.g_mut()`

### Migration Notes

- Replace all direct field accesses `.g.` with method calls `.g()` / `.g_mut()`.
- Force-directed layout imports:
  ```rust
  use egui_graphs::{LayoutForceDirected, LayoutStateForceDirected};
  ```
- Optional parameter control
  ```rust
  let mut state = view.get_layout_state::<LayoutStateForceDirected>().unwrap_or_default();
  // tweak fields...
  view.set_layout_state(state);
  ```
