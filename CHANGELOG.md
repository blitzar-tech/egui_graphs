# Changelog

## v0.27.0 (16.08.2025)

### üöÄHighlights

#### üÜï New Features

- Hover Interactions: Added from scratch! Graph nodes and edges now support hover effects, enabling more interactive and intuitive graph exploration.
- Custom Styling Hooks: Support for node and edge style hooks, allowing flexible and dynamic visual customization.
- Force-Directed Layout Enhancements:
  - Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm and extra forces for any force-directed graph.
  - Fast-forward feature for animated layouts.
  - Exposed force with an Extras wrapper for advanced usage.

#### üñ•Ô∏è  Demo

- Event filters, show/hide panels, and enhanced keybindings for better demo interactivity.
- Keybindings overlay replaced with a modern modal window.
- Debug overlay now displays steps count for animated layouts.
- Synchronized sliders and keybindings for a smoother demo experience.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Robustness

- Fixed 1-frame edge glitch and improved edge overlap handling.
- Fit-to-screen now works for single-node graphs.
- Guards for empty graphs and demo refactoring for robustness.
- Prevented negative tolerance in bezier curves.
- Ensured the graph is fully serde serializable/deserializable.

## v0.26.0 (09.08.2025)

### Highlights

#### üÜï New Features

- Added naive force-directed layout (Fruchterman‚ÄìReingold style) with adjustable simulation parameters.
- Added layout state get/set API on `GraphView` for external control/persistence.

#### üñ•Ô∏è  Demo

- Larger debug overlay text in demo.
- Demo now has a Force Directed panel (sliders + info tooltips) for live tuning.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Robustness

- Bumped `egui` to `0.32` (and refreshed related dev dependencies).
- Refactored layout logic into smaller private helpers and added physics unit tests.
