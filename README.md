## Status
The project is close to the first stable version.

Currently not optimized for large graphs. The goal is to match egui drawing speed. Further optimizations are unnecessary.

## Concept
The goal is to create a crate that expands egui's visualization capabilities and offers an easy-to-integrate, customizable graph visualization widget.

* Customization and interactivity;
* Ability to draw arbitrarily complex graphs with self-references, loops, etc.;
* Widget does not modify the provided graph and properties; instead, it generates changes, in case of any interactions, which the client can apply.
